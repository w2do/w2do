1. General System Requirements

All parts of w2do package  are standalone scripts written in Perl 5  and as
such, they should be platform independent. However, working installation of
Perl 5 is required in  order to run these scripts. If you  are using one of
Unix-like operating systems, it is highly probable that you have it already
installed.  If you are using Windows,  you can download it  free of  charge
from <http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/>.


2. Installing on Unix Systems

The easiest way to install w2do on Unix operating system (e.g. Linux, veri-
ous *BSD systems etc.) is to use the existing makefile. As a root, get into
the main directory of the w2do source package and type:

  make install

This will install all runnable scripts to the predefined /usr/local/bin and
man pages to the  /usr/local/share/man/man1,  but you can edit the Makefile
to change this behaviour according to your taste and requirements; relevant
part should be well commented and therefore easy to understand.  Similarly,

  make uninstall

will completely remove all installed files.


3. Installing on Windows

No  special  installation  is required  in order to run  w2do on  Microsoft
Windows. In your favourite command line interpreter  (e.g. cmd.exe), simply
get into the main directory of the w2do source package and type:

  perl w2do [options]

etc. Try `--help' switch to get information about the usage.
