1. General System Requirements

w2do is a single file written in Perl 5 and as such,  it should be platform
independent. However, working installation of Perl 5 is required to run the
application. If you are using one of the Un*x-like operating systems, it is
probable that you have it already installed.  If you are using Windows, you
can obtain it from  http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/ free of
charge.


2. Installing on Un*x Systems

If you are using one of the Un*x-like operating systems, the easiest way to
install w2do is to use existing Makefile.  Just get into the main directory
of the w2do source package and, as a root, type:

  make install

This will install runnable script file to the predefined /usr/local/bin and
appropriate man page  to the  /usr/local/share/man/man1.  Other destination
can be easily set by changing the value of `prefix' in the Makefile.


3. Installing on Windows

No installation is needed. In your favourite command line interpreter (e.g.
cmd.exe),  just get into the main directory  of the w2do source package and
simply run w2do as any other Perl script:

  perl w2do

Type `perl w2do --help' for usage information.
