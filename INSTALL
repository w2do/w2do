1. General System Requirements

All parts of w2do package  are standalone scripts written in Perl 5  and as
such, they should be platform independent. However, working installation of
Perl 5 is required in  order to run these scripts. If you  are using one of
Unix-like operating systems, it is highly probable that you have it already
installed.  If you are using Windows,  you can download it  free of  charge
from <http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/>.


2. Installing on Unix Systems

The easiest way to install w2do on Unix operating system (e.g. Linux, vari-
ous *BSD systems etc.) is to use the existing Makefile. As a root, get into
the src/ directory in the w2do source package and type:

  make install

This will install all executables  and their corresponding man pages to the
predefined /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/man  respectively.  If these
locations do not satisfy your needs,  you can either edit the relevant part
of the Makefile, or you can change the prefix directly on the command line:

  make prefix=/some/location install

Similarly, typing

  make uninstall

or, if you have previously changed the destination directory,

  make prefix=/some/location uninstall

will completely remove all installed files.

On the other hand, you can also run the scripts directly from their present
location or copy the content of src/ directory somewhere in the $PATH your-
self.


3. Installing on Windows

No  special  installation  is required  in order to run  w2do on  Microsoft
Windows. In your favourite command line interpreter  (e.g. cmd.exe), simply
get into the src/ directory of the w2do source package and type:

  perl w2do [options]

etc. Try `--help' switch to get information about the usage.
