1. General System Requirements

w2do is a single file written in Perl 5 and as such,  it should be platform
independent. However, working installation of Perl 5 is required to run the
application. If you are using one of the Unix-like operating systems, it is
probable that you have it already installed.  If you are using Windows, you
can obtain it from  http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/ free of
charge.


2. Installing on Unix Systems

The easiest way to install w2do on Unix operating system (e.g. Linux, veri-
ous *BSD systems etc.) is to use the existing makefile. As a root, get into
the main directory of the w2do source package and type:

  make install

This will install the runnable script to the predefined  /usr/local/bin and
manual page to the /usr/local/share/man/man1, but you can edit the Makefile
to change this behaviour according to your taste and requirements; relevant
part should be well commented and therefore easy to understand.  Similarly,

  make uninstall

will completely remove all installed files.


3. Installing on Windows

No  special  installation  is required  in order to run  w2do on  Microsoft
Windows. In your favourite command line interpreter  (e.g. cmd.exe), simply
get into the main directory of the w2do source package and type:

  perl w2do

Type `perl w2do --help' for information about the usage.
